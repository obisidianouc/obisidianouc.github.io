<h2>How to build your personal academic website with lowest cost and highest quality</h2>

<p><br/><mark><em>“ You need a comfortable home for resting, as well as a tranquil cyberspace to settle your sprit “</em></mark></p>

<p><br/><br/>When I look through the professors and researchers on the website, I note that a link pointing to their personal websites frequently occurs at the bottom of their brief introduction. I often curiously click the link and get into their personal websites. In their academic personal websites, I could find some basic information about their publications, their resume, their research interests, their student and postdoc smiling faces and etc.. In some more fancy website, they provide some useful resources including free downloaded data and problem-solving blogs. After looking through more than 20 researchers’ personal academic websites, some common features can be summarized.<br/><br/>Basic features of a good personal academic website</p>

<p><strong>1. minimized layout</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Clear introduction to what you are working on</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. photos with cool group members and yourself</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Attached CV</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. List of the publications</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. Resources (e.g. data and book)that can help others</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. Blogs that summarize their experiences</strong></p>

<p><br/>I feel very delightful to taste these personal academic websites and eventually it comes up to my mind: should I build a personal academic website for myself?</p>

<p><br/>At first I feel very reluctant because it looks like I will waste plenty of time to build and maintain my personal website. My mind had changed since the quarantine due to COVID-19 gave me more free time to rethink and explore myself. During the quarantine, the normal work-life-family balance has been destroyed and I find under this extreme circumstance, my spirit is weaker than what I expect. Anxiety and depression laid siege to my emotion and spirit. I struggled with these negative emotions and contemplated why it happened to me. Finally, I realized most of my spirit and ego have been occupied by the overwhelmed stream of the external opinions, information and activities such as parties. These illusive information makes me lose my ego, independence and critical deep thinking ability. I am becoming scared to make decisions because my weak and dependent ego, hurting my life. I started to understand the “Holy Grail of the life” is independent ego. </p>

<p><br/>One reason my ego was damaged is due to the unavoidable propagation in the modern society. Building my own personal website is one way to defend the propagation in he modern society via propagation approach itself. I need a comfortable home for resting, as well as a tranquil cyberspace to settle your sprit. Now, the biggest barrier to build personal academic website has been removed and the remaining issues just need some simple techniques and details.<br/><br/>Some commercial personal website company (e.g. wix.com) could work but they are costly and not designed well for academic use.</p>
