	* high spatial and temporal resolution of surface ocean properties, e.g. surface chlorophyll concentration, Sea Surface Temperature
1. CCHDO [link](https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/)
	* CCHDO deliver the highest possible quality global CTD and hydrographic data from WOCE, CLIVAR and numerous other oceanographic research programs

1. Go-ship program [link](https://www.go-ship.org/index.html)
	* Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program

Ocean model and tools
======
1. Ocean circulation inverse model (OCIM) from Tim DeVries group [link](https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/models-and-data-products/)
	* OCIM is a matlab-based, data-assimilation model to facilitate the simulation of biogeochemical tracers




Statistics
